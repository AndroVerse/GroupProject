Favorite Existing Apps - Categorize and Evaluate

Instagram
Category: Photo & Video / Social
Mobile: Website is view only, uses camera, mobile first experience.
Story: Allows users to share their lives in pictures and enhance their content with filters
Market: Anyone that takes pictures could enjoy this app. Ability to follow and hashtag based on interests and categories allows users with unique interests to engage with relevant content.
Habit: Users can post throughout the day many times. Features like "Stories" encourage more candid posting as well. Users can explore endless pictures in any category imaginable whenever they want. Very habbit forming!
Scope: Instagram started out extremely narrow focused, just posting pics and viewing feeds. Has expanded to a somewhat larger scope including "Instagram Stories" (a la SnapChat) and messenger features.

Tik Tok

Category: Social Media, Short-Form Video, Entertainment

Mobile: Mobile-first and essential. The entire user experience—from its vertical video format and swipe-based navigation to its powerful, on-the-go creation tools—is designed for the smartphone. While a desktop version exists for consumption, the core creation and interaction loop is fundamentally mobile.

Story: TikTok empowers anyone to be a creator and discover a world of entertaining, short-form videos. It broke the traditional "follower" model by using a powerful algorithmic "For You" Page (FYP) to surface engaging content regardless of who made it, turning ordinary users into viral sensations overnight. It's a platform for trends, culture, and unfiltered creativity.

Market: Initially dominated by Gen Z and younger Millennials, its user base has broadened exponentially to include all demographics globally. The market is twofold:

Consumers: Billions of users seeking passive entertainment, education ("Learn on TikTok"), and community.

Producers: Content creators, influencers, brands, and advertisers leveraging the platform's massive reach for marketing and e-commerce.

Habit: Extremely high-frequency usage, often multiple times per day. The core habit loop is built on the "infinite scroll" of the FYP, which functions as a variable reward system (like a slot machine). Users open the app in moments of boredom or "in-between" time (waiting in line, before bed) for a quick, passive, and highly personalized hit of entertainment.

Scope: The scope has expanded massively from its origins.

V1 (Early Days/Musical.ly): Simple, short-form (15-60s) video creation and sharing, centered on lip-syncing and dance trends.

V-Next (Current): A full-fledged "super app" that includes:

Long-form video (now up to 10 minutes, competing with YouTube).

Live streaming with virtual gifting and monetization.

A massive, integrated e-commerce platform (TikTok Shop).

Advanced creator monetization tools (Creator Fund, subscription models).

Direct messaging, "Friends" tab, and other social networking features.

A powerful search engine that is a primary discovery tool for Gen Z.
